[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cliwrap/bionic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cliwrap/bionic)

The `Dockerfile` in this repository builds a `ubuntu:18.04` container
(with `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade` run) which lets you run
commands inside the container using a UID and GID which are passed in
environment variables from outside the container, so that any files
created in a volume mount can be created as the user and group who
initiated `docker run`.
